This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in COBOL related to incrementing numeric variables.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code that uses the `ADD TO` statement incorrectly, potentially leading to unexpected results or compiler errors. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides the corrected code, illustrating the proper use of the `COMPUTE` statement for incrementing values.  This bug highlights a subtle difference in how some COBOL compilers handle this type of operation.
